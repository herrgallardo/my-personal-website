            Born with a deep interest in languages and cultures, I completed a
            degree in Spanish and Linguistics at Lund University. This education
            gave me an understanding of language structures, which later helped
            me transition into coding and web development. I pursued a
            Full-stack Development program at Teknikh√∂gskolan i Lund, developing
            skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, HTML, CSS,
            GraphQL, Git, and Jira.

            My journey has been diverse, with work experiences in Granada,
            London, and Lund, including managerial roles and customer service.
            I&apos;ve also held positions such as a Spanish language instructor
            and have extensive experience in the service industry. These roles
            have equipped me with collaboration, leadership, and resilience
            skills.

            After internships and jobs at Axis Communications and 24HR, I am now
            looking for a full-time front-end developer role. I bring a unique
            blend of linguistic knowledge, coding skills, and a wide range of
            soft skills, eager to contribute to a team that values technical
            ability and diverse experiences.
